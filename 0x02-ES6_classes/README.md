# Project Title: ES6 Classes

## Description

This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript, specifically using ES6 classes. The primary goal is to provide a hands-on experience in working with classes, methods, static methods, and inheritance.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external sources:

1. How to define a Class
2. Adding methods to a class
3. Adding static methods to a class
4. Extending a class from another
5. Metaprogramming and symbols

## Requirements

- All files executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- Files must end with a new line
- README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use the js extension
- Testing using Jest with the command `npm run test`
- Verification against lint using ESLint with `npm run full-test`

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
