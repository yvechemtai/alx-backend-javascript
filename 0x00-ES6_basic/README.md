- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code.
- Files should end with a new line.
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.

### Code

- Use the `.js` extension for your code.
- Code will be tested using the Jest Testing Framework.
- Code will be analyzed using the ESLint linter with specific provided rules.
- All functions must be exported.

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x in your home directory:
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo apt install nodejs -y
   ```
   Verify installations:
   ```bash
   nodejs -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint:
   In your project directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configuration files:
   Add the following files to your project directory:
   - `package.json`
   - `babel.config.js`
